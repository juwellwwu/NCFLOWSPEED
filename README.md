# NCFLOWSPEED

This package includes custom MATLAB scripts for blood flow analysis for in vivo negative contrast imaging as described in:

Jung, Wu et al. Intravital fluorescence microscopy with negative contrast. 

The scripts were last revised and tested in MATLAB R2018a, using a 3.1GHz Intel Core i7 MacBookPro with 16Gb memory. This package also includes a sample image stack for running a demo and a copy of the DEMO output.
